With aSelectproperty, add meeting type tags to indicate whether it’s a standup, weekly sync, etc.\n• Choose a list layout sorted by date— SelectSort, byDate, andDescendingto view the most recent meetings first.\n• Group or filter according to meeting type— If you want to review notes from the design team’s recent meetings, you can group the database by meeting type or attendees. You can then save those filtered views to come back to in future.\n• Take meeting notes inside the database entry— When a new meeting takes place, simply create a new item in the database, fill in relevant properties and start taking notes.\n• Use templates to speed up note-taking and improve accuracy— Set up a template for each different kind of recurring meeting. Inside the template, have key properties already filled out where possible. Add some page content like bullet points, a checklist and some useful headings so you can jump straight into note-taking as the meeting begins."

With properties, you can add more context compared to a regular document, from dynamic properties like created date and last edited date, to select properties to label documents and status property to tag docs as In Progress, Complete, etc.\n• Create templates for often-used documents— Fill out properties and add an outline of page content so you never have to draw up a technical spec, architecture overview, or project scope from scratch.\n• Format documents aesthetically— Inside the page, you can organize text into columns, headers, bullets, checklists, images, embeds, and more. It’s up to you to design your documents however makes the most sense. You can even embed databases within the page, or sync content from other tools like GitHub and Jira."

Create a separate database for tasks, and use a relation property to connect them. That way, you can attach tasks to relevant projects, and you can see how close your projects are to completion.\n• Group tasks by project, assignee, or due date— Easily see all tasks by their corresponding project or due date. Grouping tasks by assignee is a great way to see what each of your team members has on their plate.\n• Use a progress bar to show project completion— You can add a satisfying progress bar to show how close you are to completing your projects. First, add a  rollup property to your projects database. When you edit the relation, choose “Tasks”, and select the status property. Then, select “Calculate percent per group” and choose “complete.”  Now, whenever you move tasks into “completed” you’ll see your progress bar move closer to 100%.\n• View ongoing projects on a timeline— See how different project commitments cross over by creating a timeline view of projects. Make sure your projects have a start and end date so you can visualize their duration."

You can group the board database by the status property, so you easily move cards across from In Progress to Done for example.\n• View launch or publish deadlines on a calendar— Calendar layouts are useful when you want to see database entries plotted by date. You can use a calendar to see when content goes live or when new features are due for release.\n• Timelines let you visualize your workload and deadlines— If you’re managing a team, timelines can be a helpful way to look at projects because you can see how much you have on your plate at any one time."
